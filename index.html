          Hey. I'm Marc, a self-taught web designer and developer,
          exploring the craft of building simple, meaningful digital
          experiences.

        <h2>Other Pursuits</h2>
        <h3>Badminton</h3>
        <p>
          I play and coach badminton. At some point I'd like to write about
          everything I've learned from 15+ years of playing the sport.
        </p>
        <h3>Piano</h3>
        <p>
          I play around 30 minutes to an hour each day. Check out some of my
          recordings!
        </p>
        <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>
          I've done some pencil drawings and paintings in high school. Recently
          I've started making some digital art as well.
